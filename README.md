MyTrails
================================

*What are the most popular hikes between 4-6 miles within an hour of Seattle that I've never hiked before?*

[WTA.org](http://www.wta.org) has an amazing collection of hike data, but searching for a hike always leaves something to be desired. Enter MyTrails.

MyTrails uses WTA's data and pushes it into its own store. It supports adding extended trail data, like driving times from your house. The data is made available for filtering and browsing in Excel.

MyTrails makes it extremely easy to find your next hike. Start with all known trails in Washington State, and then filter it down by any combination of:
* Mileage, elevation gain, and elevation per mile.
* Required trail pass
* Driving time from your home location
* Most recent and total number of trip reports
* Trail characteristics (good for kids, dogs allowed, established campsites, etc.)
* When you last visited
* ... and more!

MyTrails is hosted in the cloud and Excel spreadsheets are available on [SkyDrive](http://sdrv.ms/11RQM8D). Grab one for your home location:
* [Auburn](http://sdrv.ms/10yUsJQ)
* [Bellevue](http://sdrv.ms/10yUv8K)
* [Bothell](http://sdrv.ms/XdRVHt)
* [Federal Way](http://sdrv.ms/XdRWez)
* [Kirkland](http://sdrv.ms/XdRXPw)
* [Redmond](http://sdrv.ms/XdRYDk)
* [Seattle](http://sdrv.ms/XdS1ik)

Each spreadsheet is pre-populated with the full list of trail data from WTA. Pull in the latest updates by refreshing the data through Excel (Data > Refresh All). Save your own version to track your trail visits and notes.
