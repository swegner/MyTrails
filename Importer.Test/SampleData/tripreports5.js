    "BodyText": "Combined the Hiram Chittenden locks and Discovery Park in a longer walk Sunday morning.  We parked at the locks lot and crossed over to the south side then walked up Commodore Way to the north entrance to the park. <br /><br />Followed the Loop Trail around the east and south side of the park then dropped down the South Beach trail to the West Point Light house.  The trail around the very tip of the point is closed due to erosion.  The North Beach trail back up to the parade grounds is marked as closed due to erosion/flooding as well - but is passable - just be very careful over one of the pedestrian bridges towards the bottom of the hill.  Looped back around through the north parking lot and back down to the locks.  <br /><br />Starting at the locks adds less than 2 miles to the very nice Discovery Park loop and a bunch of extra views and interesting things to look at.  A beautiful morning!",

    "BodyText": "The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, but it was Sacred Hiking Monday, so we went anyway. We headed to Seattle, it was cloudy and dark, a perfect day to hike downtown, in a park. The trail was wide and sometimes even paved, and we could stand on the bluffs and watch ships, hawks and small waves.  The bluffs are steep, don't cross over the rails, to get to the lighthouse and beach just follow the trails. We ate lunch on the beach, then climbed back up the hill, a little elevation to gain, what a thrill! The main loop around is about 3 miles, there's more little trails, you could spend quite a while. When we reached the car,  we were both wet and cold, and we still had to sit in traffic, which gets real old.  So,if you can't go to the mtn.s and do what you like? Go into the city, and try this short hike!",

    "BodyText": "This was my first sunset hike to Discovery Park. I parked in the North parking lot. I took the road uphill, starting towards the Northwest, for 1/2 mile, then turned onto the South Beach Trail. I completed a loop to the South Beach, past the West Point lighthouse, to the North Beach, and then back to the road via the North Beach Trail. Couples were enjoying the sunset by the beach. Clouds broke up the sunset over the Olympics, but there were nice views of Rainier, Baker, and the lighthouse at sunset. Sunset took place at about 7:30 pm. In fact, the lighthouse actually is in operation! The trail is in great condition, and there are some wildflowers in bloom. Blackberries are in varying stages of ripeness. Total mileage was about 2, with 150 feet of elevation change.",

    "BodyText": "Today was wet, Tom and I, even in our rain uniforms, got wet, that was the bad news.  The good news was that the trails (Discovery Park Loop) were in good shape with a few water puddles but nothing that could not be stepped over or around.<br /><br />We started out from 64th and 24th in the City and went downhill to the locks, over the locks and around to the Park and the loop trail.  We did about 4 to 4.5 miles total and at 11:30 stopped at the Lock Spot for lunch with our wives.  No real problems other than the weather. <br /><br />Discovery Park is a great in city walk and crossing the locks adds to the walk.  Spring is happening, even with the wet weather, some plants in the park are beginning to flower.<br /><br />The benefit of the hike included being able to get a warm lunch in a dry spot (today very welcome) and having a warm shower and dry clothes at the end of the morning.",

The trip was pleasant, with friends and a cute schnauzer. We did a brief and easy hike from the North Parking Lot to the beach and checked the outside of the Indian Cultural Center along the way. We plan to come back to visit the West Point light house sometime soon!!",

    "BodyText": "From the South Parking Lot we took the Loop Trail down to the South Beach Trail. The trail is well maintained and well traveled. There were quite a few joggers and other hikers out today. The trail is 1.5 miles down to the beach from the parking lot. There are a number of stairs that you go down to get to the beach. Those were a bit slippery so take care with little ones. On your return trip you will have to climb back up all of those stairs, but there are plenty of benches for weary hikers to rest. I was a little disappointed that some of the viewpoints along the trail were overgrown with vegetation that sometimes obstructed the views.<br /><br />This is a great urban hike for those not wanting to drive too far, but wanting to get out and enjoy nature anyway. It's a great hike for all ages and young children should do just fine (although you may want to allot more time for the hike back up the hill). There is plenty of beach to explore and even a beach &quot;fort&quot; for kids to play in. The lighthouse, however, was closed so we were not able to explore it. And of course fantastic scenery of the Sound. I would love to come back on a sunny day. I bet the views of the Sound (and the Olympics) would be fantastic.<br /><br />To see more of our hike visit <a href=\"http://1retromama.blogspot.com/2011/12/discovery-park-seattle-parks-magnolia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://1retromama.blogspot.[&hellip;]seattle-parks-magnolia.html</a> .",

    "BodyText": "Discovery Park has so many trails from which to choose, all of which have their charms. We arrived at 10 am with no particular trail in mind. The parking lot near the Visitor Center was full, but the North parking lot was relatively empty when we arrived, though it was about 75% full when we got back at 12:30 pm. We decided upon the Loop Trail, but could not resist the temptation of going on a side-trip to the South Beach Trail, and we ended up enjoying the beach views for most of our hike. We went down to the lighthouse, then back up to the parking lot.<br /><br />Along the way, we saw wildflowers (many getting old, though), berries (mostly past their prime as well), Mt Baker, the Olympics, Mt Rainer, a Pacific banana slug, anemones, and barnacles (it was low-tide). There were some spectacular seashells on the beach, as well. A great outing, especially for a fall day with sun-breaks!",

    "BodyText": "GWEN'S HIKE-A-THON NO.2<br /><br />Since I'm aiming for 50 miles this August for the Hike-A-Thon, I need to average 12.5 miles each weekend.  Friday's hike was delightful and delicious but at only 9 miles, I needed to make some up.  I had things to do in the city so I decided a trip over to Discovery Park was in order.  It used to be one of my &quot;go to&quot; places when I lived in the city, along with Carkeek Park.<br /><br />There are a myriad of trails that loop around and twist through the 534 acres of Discovery Park, the &quot;official&quot; ones fairly well signed and the secret ones not so much. You can wander through forests and meadows or trundle along the beach.  Or, like me, you can choose all of the above.<br /><br />I started out on the Loop trail clockwise from the North parking lot, but quickly got sidetracked by secret trails.  What can I say, I like to explore.  Said exploration ended abruptly, however, when I decided that it was not prudent to do so while wearing shorts and short sleeves as the park is absolutely riddled with stinging nettles and there's absolutely no way of avoiding them on the brushy narrow unmarked trails.  So, back to the Loop.<br /><br />At the junction with the South Beach trail, I descended toward the beach, looped around the lighthouse to the North Beach area, and followed that back up to rejoin the Loop and finish off at 3.9 miles.<br /><br />All the trails in Discovery Park are in good shape and stairs are installed to aid in access to and from the beach.  While the park may be busy on any given day (especially a weekend), it never feels crowded. In fact, some of our wilderness trails have felt more crowded to me at time (Lake 22, for instance). I like (and prefer) Wilderness like many of you, but sometimes, when you'd rather put miles on the feet instead of the car wheels, it's nice to know there's an in-city option.",

A multitude of sea life was available for viewing including star fish, crab and sea anemones.  <br /><br />While one has to be aware of tides and wear shoes/socks that can and will get wet.  It is a real in city treat.  My sense was that we were at the aquarium with the best views of the living coast.  <br /><br />Total walking was about 1.5 to 2.0 miles and care needs to be taken to avoid getting caught by an incoming tide.",
