Mangy Marmot give good directions here <a href=\"http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2012-06-26.0223674110\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wta.org/[&hellip;]/trip_report.2012-06-26.0223674110</a> , basically everything you need to know to get to the top is there.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised to get just my kind of hill - short, really steep, secluded, and a surprisingly nice view in all directions on top.  I would call this a climbers route more than a hiking trail.  There is no pretense of switch backs, it just climbs straight up the NW ridge of Humpback, through third, then second growth forest closer to the top.  The main bummer is that your back is to the roar of I90 all the way up and you don't really lose it until you get to the top.   I'd give it a difficulty similar to Snoqualmie Mtn trail, but for me, the vibe of this place is Mailbox...15 years ago. <br /><br />I hope this trail doesn't make it to any hiking guides because too many boots would turn this nice trail into a mud bog, like Mailbox has become since it was 'discovered' by people (like me, admittedly).  I debated on whether or not to post a report for that reason, but I see it's all been pretty well documented, and appears to be a popular snowshoe.  I wouldn't have found it without noticing Marmot's report the other day, but let's just keep it between us here, OK?<br /><br />.",

    "BodyText": "I did a quick after work trip to Humpback Mountain. The trail was in good condition. There were a couple of minor navigation challenges. I parked under the trestle on road 5510 and made my way up to the Iron Horse Trail. To find the real trail, go East on the Iron Horse. Look for posts with Orange warnings saying something like Buried Cable on the right side of the trail. The trail starts right at post 720. I started down the wrong trail right by the trestle which soon vanished.<br /><br />The other navigation issue was at the first road. When you reach the first road, go left (east). Look for a gap in the trees and a sandy slope. That's it. Stay to the right. Once you are on the trail it's clear sailing. There is a little bit of snow here and there near the top, but the trail stays near the ridge, so it's easy to find.<br /><br />To get on to the summit ridge, you have to get up wall of snow about 15 ft or so high. Ice axe is handy here. It can probably be done without it. Once on the ridge, the summit is only a short distance away.",

    "BodyText": "J. &amp; I endeavored Humpback Mountain for the second time this Spring (our earlier attempt foiled by the road being blocked by a large fallen tree a couple miles from the trailhead).  We had okay information on how to find the trailhead, but still missed it (more on that later), so we eventually tried a path that looked promising, but it was a mineral scavenging route, and didn't lead us anywhere.  We bushwhacked our way back to the trail eventually, but it wasn't fun trudging a mile or more through brush on a steep hill with loose soil.  Starting at the trailhead is highly recommended.<br /><br />The trail pretty much goes to the top right along the ridge without switchbacks, a constant, but tolerable, climb.  It's completely dry down low, but the last quarter or more of the hike is in snow, becoming quite deep up high.  The snow is starting to give way just enough that you need to be careful of eroding snow bridges and such, but it's still mostly quite solid to walk on.  We were fine with boot traction and appreciated having poles;  snowshoes wouldn't have helped.<br /><br />The views from up high are amazing, and it's quiet once you get away from the scavengers and shooters (we didn't see anyone else going up or down that day on Humpback, but plenty of people engage in target practice lower down).  We skipped the last couple hundred feet to the summit--one of my knees not being terribly happy with the slanted sidewalk expedition through the brush--but next time we'll go back and start from the trailhead and it will be a much easier trek to the top.<br /><br />TO FIND THE TRAILHEAD:  Use the directions on this fine web page, or others, and start at the second &quot;switchback&quot; on Forest Road 5510:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hikingwithmybrother.com/2010/06/humpback-mountain-trail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hikingwithmybrother.com/[&hellip;]/humpback-mountain-trail.html</a><br /><br />Park at the switchback, and continue north instead of switching back, so you're walking up a moderate hill (an old road).  After 10 to 15 minutes, the road will curve to the right.  Shortly thereafter, look for a medium sized washout on your right (see photo below).  Walk up the washout, and the trailhead is about 10 or 15 paces up, on your right.  You can't really see it from the road, which is why we missed it.  Enjoy!",

I'm surprised no one has mentioned this before, since we encountered the same thing a week earlier.

Steep ascend of ~200 ft on to John Wayne, then turn left until the 2nd AT&amp;T post on the upper side of the trail, where the summer trail starts and continues along the ridge line, and crossing logging roads twice. Being able to find and follow this summer trail made a huge difference - otherwise we would find ourselves trapped in dense bushes most of the time!<br /><br />Snow started to appear at about 3000 ft and was not causing problem with poles (we didn't have to put on snowshoes all the way). Reaching ~4800 ft there was an open, south-facing slope that offered great view, including Mt Rainier. Continuing along the ridge line, there were many icy spots. Ice axes were required for the last 200 ft because of ice and steepness. Awesome 360 views at the top!<br /><br />On the way down, we heard many gun shots, realizing people probably were doing target practice where we started. So from John Wayne Trail down, I blew my whistle hard continuously to alert the shooters. They heard me and stopped shooting. So we were able to get down safely (I raised both hands up high when walking towards them). <br /><br />2 miles one way, 3100 ft gain, reached top in 3 hours. We were the first group.

    "BodyText": "Summary: Beautiful hike and a great choice when elevated avalanche conditions make other hikes an unwise choice.  7 hour round trip with long lunch and summit visit. <br />Equipment: There was no need for an ice axe given the snow conditions, but on an icy day you\u2019d be happy to have one.  We were definitely glad to have our snowshoes as the upper part of the ridge is slightly steep.  <br />Forest road 55 was covered in about a foot of new snow when we arrived and since we were driving a Toyota Camry we had to park on the bridge.  (Note: by the end of the day the 10 or so SUVs that had driven the road had cleared nice tracks.  The worst of the snow is actually at the start of the road, so if you think you can make that, then you should be fine later on.)  We left the car around 10:45am.<br />We hiked all the way from the bridge to the trail head.  Funny side note: While hiking the road we were passed by about 8 SUVs, but we ended up beating them all because the lead SUV got stuck and all of them had to back down the road (we did not envy the drivers backing down the steep road in the snow).  <br />We were the first to hike the berm road since the new snow, but a group of mountaineers had headed up before us taking a different route to the berm road.  Their tracks led us to the trail which would have been hard to find otherwise.  The trailhead is at least 100 feet beyond the rock slope at the nose of the NW ridge \u2013 we didn\u2019t see any signs for it.  The trail is small and not very well marked, but route finding was easy for us since we were following tracks (the mountaineer only seemed to lose the trail once so maybe it's not that bad).   The best thing you can do is look for lopped branches and the occasional pink ribbon. <br />The snow at the berm road had a half-inch rain crust, but it was light and fluffy by the time we crossed the upper road.  <br />Conditions at the summit were ideal \u2013 blue skies and great views - tons of great powder.   Given our long approach it was 5:30 when we reached the car so we were glad we had brought our headlamps.   Fantastic day!  I\u2019ll definitely hit this hike again because it\u2019s so unused. ",

    "BodyText": "This is a great hike for a clear day on the weekend, I did not see a soul on the trail and only passed two groups of firearm enthusiasts on the road on the way out. When compared to the nearly 30 cars I saw in the High Point Trailhead overflow parking just off I-90, or the 100 or so that surely climbed Mt Si today, I knew I made the right choice. It's hard to believe that this hike gets so little traffic, as I found it to be no more difficult or out of the way than Mailbox Peak yet just as rewarding. I also found the trail to be surprisingly well beaten and easy to follow even with 3 inches of fresh powder, despite what I have read in several trip reports. I only had difficulty through 2 small talus fields near the top, and only because I lacked the confidence to go straight over them while covered in a solid layer of snow. <br /><br />I highly recommend this hike to any well seasoned hiker in good shape. Take exit 47 off I-90, head south and turn right at the &quot;T&quot;, following Tinkham rd for about 1 mile, then turn left onto rd 5510, follow this 1 mile and park where the just after the first hairpin turn at the juction in the -second hairpin turn. This left-hand turn off runs north for about a mile before a dead end, about half way down on the right is the start of the trail. The trail crosses one more forest service road(another acces option) a few hundred feet up and closely follows the NW ridge all the way to the summit. Stay on this NW ridge and you can't go wrong.",

The steep and relentless grade makes it a training hike, but not ideal for a causal walk in the woods. Still, it is a short amount of distance to get views normally reserved for much longer hikes. If the hike is too short for your taste, you can extend the hike down the other side of Humpback to Scout Lake, though we understand the trail down to the lake is something of a scramble. Humpback Mountain is also not as well known as other nearby hikes, so it is also a great alternative on those crowded sunny days.

The first mile of the hike was quite easy on an old road past several active mining claims.  There was a significant penalty for this first easy part.  The &quot;trail&quot; has Mailbox qualities but only for about 1200 vertical feet.  Then there was relatively flat section to recover aerobically before the steep trail/boulder hop to the summit ridge.  Paul, also infamous for his foot massage prowess, has really improved this section.  At least we assumed it was Paul since there was his characteristic smiley faces on one of the trimmed roots.  There was still some route finding necessary on this section where 3 or 4 boulder sections must be crossed.  At the summit ridge, one could be tempted to stop there but the true summit was a short distance to the south.  The views from this summit are 360 degree with especially good views north and east into the Alpine Lakes area and as far east as Mt Stuart.
