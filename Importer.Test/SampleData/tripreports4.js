    "BodyText": "This was a great arrival day hike for our camping trip; very short and beautiful. It is hard to believe the guide description could be true when coming from the desert-like Entiat area to just 30 miles upstream. The water is really flowing and just about every superlative the guide description uses is right on. Even the name &quot;Silver&quot; Falls fits perfectly. With the sunlight coming through high clouds it really looks beyond white.<br />On a Thursday at 5:30 pm there were 3 other cars in the parking lot but we did not see any others on the trail. With the cool evening temperatures and mist from the falls, we did not need any water. Just to mention, the free falling water is fairly small (as seen in the guide picture) but the cascades are just spectacular. The only negative I can come up with is that the mist from the falls/cascades prevent picture taking from a few spots.<br />There is a nice campground in the same area that was only lightly populated. No bugs was an additional bonus.",

    "BodyText": "Those fortunate enough to live over here may already know about this falls - a worthy destination for a morning or afternoon.<br /><br />Well-constructed granite stair-steps wind up the hill beneath an imposing boulder face, and staggered ponderosa pines provide an inviting canopy for birds.  On this day the falls were positively over-spilling their bounds, and the creek crashing somewhat incongruously between the trunks of second-growth trees.  Hand rails assist on the steep parts and adorn the bridges with curlicued style, and benches beckon at every turn.<br /><br />Washington certainly excels in its waterfalls.",

    "BodyText": "This is a beautiful little hike tucked away in a sleepy corner of the Northern Cascades. The trail is a loop. I took the trail leading to the right. The first part of the hike has short inclines. At the peak of the small climbs there are pull outs with benches. While the climbs themselves, may not leave one breathless, the views will. Great places to compose photos and rest. The waterfall itself has many stages. At one rest point there is great side view of the water fall just few yards away. There is a rail blocking the trail going behind waterfall, but it looks as if at one time a person could walk out behind the waterfall. I was a good hiker and stayed behind the rail. (I did not want to get my camera equipment wet) After a bit the trail veers right and the sound of the waterfall becomes faint and distant. This long stretch seems fruitless, until a few switchbacks brings back the roaring sound of the rushing water. At the top there is a bridge crossing the stream. This is a great place to reflect on the climb and enjoy the fruit of all the effort put forth. It is also an opportunity for the dogs to get a drink and quinch their thirst with cool water from a mountain stream. The hike down is filled with more breath taking photo opportunities. The bottom of the trail connects back with the original trail. When I go back I will be taking the left side up. I hope to get a different prospective and even more photo opportunities.",

    "BodyText": "My wife and I hiked this with our 8- and 10-year old daughters on a warm summer day. Bugs were moderately bad at the parking lot by the road, but as soon as we got up by the falls, the cool breeze from the water kept them away.<br /><br />Neither the hike description above or Ira Spring's guidebook do justice to this hike. I had thought Silver Falls was just going to be a single falls. Instead, you have several hundred feet of cascades down the hillside in addition to the falls themselves. There's something to see at every turn, except when you get into the gentle switchbacks going out from the falls toward the top. Even then, you are rewarded with great views of the Entiat River valley.<br /><br />Silver Falls is a magnificent testament to the hard work of the CCC, with all the great craftsmanship of the stairs and viewpoints.<br /><br />Great day hike and doable with children (who are willing to put in the 600 foot elevation gain).",

The trail is clear of snow and blow-downs, is dry and in great shape. The creek is flowing very high with snow melt and the falls are quite spectacular. Hiked the whole loop with 2 5 year olds and a dad with a bad ankle with no issues. Weather was perfect, sunny and high 70s. Plenty of shade and water spray to keep things comfortable. Great hike for the kids if you are in the Entiat river area. Only 1 mile long with lots of benches for rest stops and only a few steep spots.</p>",
