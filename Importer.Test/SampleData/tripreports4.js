We parked at the Bagley Lakes TH which is just past the Picture Lake Trail. We turned left when we reached the trail around the lakes crossing the arched stone bridge to continue on the Chain Lakes Trail climbing 1200 feet in 2.5 miles to Herman Saddle with views of Shuksan and Mt Baker. The fall colors were beautiful. There were several lavender daisies and yellow flowers I can't identify blooming along the trail above the lakes and 2 varieties of butterflies enjoying their beauty. We had lunch at Herman Saddle and then retraced our steps to the TH to enjoy the beauties of the trail a second time around!",

    "BodyText": "As spectacular as this hike normally is, it's particularly impressive this time of year.<br /><br />We parked at Artist Point and headed clockwise from there. Starting in the morning and hiking in this direction gives you the clearest views of Baker and Shuksan but does mean that the hike ends with a decent climb. I can't complain about that, though, given that we spent the day surrounded by brilliant colors. The display is most vivid east of the saddle but nice just about everywhere. Between the colors, the views, and the perfect autumn weather, this may be the best hike I've done all year.<br /><br />There is no snow on the trail itself, but a few side trails will involve crossing a snowfield or two. I encountered ice only once but imagine it could be a real problem if you hike early in the morning. Bugs are few and far between. The worst thing I could say about the trail is that it is sometimes rather rocky.<br /><br />This week may be your last chance to enjoy the hike before the snow arrives, so I recommend finding any excuse you can. What a day!",

    "BodyText": "Three days, four hikes, totally awesome each one.  The Artist Ridge trail to Huntoon Point is actually a braided network of trails that amble all over the ridge.  The main trail is very easy, wheelchair accessible for most of it, negligible elevation gain, and only one mile round trip.  The only difficulty is that you have to stop every 5 feet to gawk in awe at Mt. Shuksan which looms in all its glory right in front of you.  Of course there are all the heather meadows, deep valleys, and gorgeous terrain which also hold your attention.<br /><br />Table Mountain is a very different story, especially if you have vertigo.  The trail starts pleasantly enough from Artist Point parking lot but then switchbacks steeply up the face of a rock cliff totally exposed for about 50 yards.  The tread is wide enough but it is a long way down from the edges.  On top, you can wander for almost a mile to the end on gently rolling hummocks with snow in between and groves of trees here and there.  Wide open views of Baker, Shuksan, and almost the entire North Cascades from up here.<br /><br />Chain Lakes is a moderate 6 mile loop that takes you through rocky valleys, over passes, around lakes, and along the south slope of Table Mountain for a full frontal view of Mt. Baker.  Our work party cleared drainages and worked tread on both ends of this trail.  Two of us dashed up to Herman Saddle to look down on Iceberg and the other Chain Lakes.  This trail is very popular.  There were at least 200 hikers on the south stretch which gave us the opportunity to do more outreach for WTA than shovel work. <br /><br />There is one bad stretch of about 10 yards on the north end of the Chain Lakes trail after it crosses the stone bridges.  This is a rock cut section that was blasted out of the cliff years ago but not finished.  The tread is uneaven, slippery when wet, and exposed straight down into the lake below.  Very difficult to navigate on a damp morning with tools in each hand.",

This hike has it all, two major mountains, lakes, tarns, snow fields, blue lake water with small white icebergs floating in it, some fall colors beginning on the ground cover, streams, wildflowers and all surrounded by peaks, ridges valleys and views of glaciers of Mt Baker.<br /><br />We began at the Bagley Lakes trailhead #682 and hiked counterclockwise along the bagley Lakes. Lunch was at a location between Iceberg and Hayes Lake and then we descended slightly to near the level with Iceberg Lake and climbed along and above Mazama Lake. After passing the Lake we had a small snow field to cross below the north wall of Table Mountain following a ridge trail to Artist Point. We then took the Wild Goose trail back to the trailhead.<br /><br />After the large permanent cairns every ten feet along the Wild Goose trail and we crossed the road a couple times, it was a bit difficlt to find the trail after it came to a few parking lots.",

The upper route is shorter and shaded much of the time.<br /><br />The views from Herman Saddle are extraordinary--Baker on one side and Shuksan on the other.  Iceberg Lake is stunning.<br /><br />We found a kit containing contact lenses and a pair of eyeglasses on a rock by Mazama Lake.

Once I got on the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail, the crowds started to diminish. Compared to others I've done in the past, I thought this was a pretty easy hike. Not much elevation gain either. With the warm temperatures and nice cool breeze, it was a pleasant trip. Amazing views all around every step of the way. Ice axes are not required for snow crossings. Poles might be helpful, but I still managed to make it to Camp Kiser without any in tennis shoes. Took a detour to find a geocache .5 miles from the main trail and discovered a nice set of lakes that had an icy blue color. Beautiful. Also saw a few herds of mountain goats in the distance.

    "BodyText": "Spectacular hike. I arrived around 9:00 AM at the visitor center on Friday and there were only two other cars in the lot. I began the hike here, and took the steep slog up to Artist Point, I took the hike clockwise to avoid this steep portion during the heat of the day.  Note that while this is a loop hike, the trail intersects here at either end of the parking area, it would have been more difficult to find the trail if starting from Artist Point and going counter-clockwise.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there is a large snowfield at the junction of the Chain Lakes &amp; Ptarmigan ridge. This was the largest of the remaining snowy areas. There are another couple snow fields above Iceberg Lake, but the trail was visible across the snow so it was pretty easy to see where to go,even for a snow-wimp like me.  <br /><br />There is one area of the trail I found to be confusing, when it's time to traverse between Iceberg &amp; Hayes Lake, the more 'traveled' looking part of the trail heads left, but that is not the Chain Lakes trail (I believe it's camps at Hayes Lake), the Chain Lakes trail heads right, marked by a inconspicuous sign on a tree for Bagley Lakes, this is the correct way to go. Unfortunately, as I had forgotten my map, this was a brief point of confusion for me, this spot might benefit from a new sign.  <br /><br />I shared the trail with a few other hikers but had a lot of solitude.<br /><br />This hike is just beautiful,spectacular views of both Shuksan and Mt. Baker. What a lovely day for time in the mountains.",

    "BodyText": "I arrived at the Artist's Point parking lot around 10:30, and there were about 20 cars there. It took 2:50 from my house west of Greenlake. When I returned at 2, there were hundreds (the lot was full, and overflowing down the road). Start early-ish, or walk with the mobs. <br /><br />It was surprisingly cold and overcast when I arrived--probably in the upper 40s. There was a very reasonable amount of people on the way in to the lakes (I did an out-and-back) but coming back down toward the parking lot in the afternoon, there was a steady stream of people. Many large family groups. The trail is pretty narrow and it traverses steep slopes, so you have to walk single file, or pull over for people. The trail has two lingering (not going away at this point) snowfields right after the turnoff from the Ptarmigan Ridge trail, but the snow is soft, and they are fairly easy to cross right now (even little kids were doing it, though a teenager in Converse had trouble). I imagine in the early morning, or within the next few weeks as the weather cools, these will be very icy and not safe. <br /><br />I brought my older dog, and this wasn't really a great hike for a dog. There is lots of loose scree, the trail is always narrow, the drop off is steep, and there are so many people (a lot of people don't like getting close to a dog on a narrow trail). A younger or athletic dog will be fine but I think it was a bit challenging for my big, older guy. I kept him leashed most of the way so he wouldn't get in anyone's way, or fall off the trail down the slope (it's happened!). But the scenery was stunning. It's amazing you can hike through this kind of landscape with so little effort.",

    "BodyText": "A sunny, partly cloudy, cool day greeted us for hiking the Chain Lakes Loop.  A couple of years ago in October we hiked part of this trail up to Herman's Saddle and decided then to return to do the entire loop some day.  Today was the day.  We began on the Wild Goose Trail and climbed steeply up to Artist Point and the junction with the Ptarmigan Ridge trail. After a mile or so, we turned right up to the Chain Lakes trail.  There are still quite a few snow fields to cross, a couple of them quite large, which gave us a bit of a challenge but no major problems.  A couple times we lost the main trail due to snow and/or the dozens of side trails people have unfortunately created -- it's a heavily trodden route apparently.  We found our way, though, and it was an awesome hike. About 2/3 of this loop trail is very rocky.  That slowed us down significantly, especially when going downhill, but then we are never fast hikers, always stepping aside for the folks who like to set land-speed records on the trails.  The wildflowers were abundant but not yet at their peak.  Some of the blueberry bushes are already turning crimson, which we remembered put on quite a show when we were there in October.  The views of both Mt. Shuksan and Mt. Baker along this trail are astounding, and the chain lakes themselves are very picturesque. We found this trail to be challenging for our 60+ year-old bod's but we trudged along steadily and enjoyed the day immensely.",

    "BodyText": "Hiked the Chain Lakes Loop for the first time, using the description in Day Hiking North Cascades by Craig Romano (Mountaineers Books). Nutshell: gorgeous hike, a few snowfields but easily managed even for a wimp like me, but you'll need a car shuttle at the end.<br /><br />We started at the lower trailhead for Heather Meadows and went around the right side of Bagley Lakes. There is one snowfield with a broken snowbridge, but you can easily traverse through the middle (see the picture), and up the other side. Very easy. Kids were doing it.<br /><br />From there the trail heads up, up, up, with increasingly gorgeous views of Shuksan, until you ascend Herman Saddle. Lots of wildflowers and pretty trickles of water. (Berry bushes are barely showing fruit, I wonder if it will ripen before the snow flies?)  We stopped for lunch at the saddle, the breezes were pleasant and kept the few bugs at bay.<br /><br />From there, the trail heads down to Iceberg Lake and you cross several slushy but flat snow fields. The snow is melting rapidly, using the trail as its path, so the trail is filled with running snowmelt and is getting eroded on this part of the hike. People are creating new trails outside the rut to avoid the badly eroded or wet sections.<br /><br />When you get down to Iceberg Lake, the trail evens out and melts out, and you start to see a few more people who have come in from the Artist Point side. (Up until this point, we only saw a handful of people.) There is one log down in the trail, looks like it's been there a while. No problem to cross.<br /><br />The trail is in great condition until you hit the last snowpatch right where the trail crests the ridge at the junction with the Ptarmigan Ridge trail. That snowfield looks a bit ominous from the top but it's easy and mushy, no problem at all.<br /><br />Here was our biggest challenge of the hike, and it came at the end when we were already a bit tired:  when we got to Artist Point we couldn't find the (aptly named) Wild Goose Trail to close the loop and get back to the car. We are thinking the start of the trail, and maybe more, is still buried from where they plowed the road and parking lot. <br /><br />We thought about walking down the road, as the book suggests you might have to do if the trail is snow covered. And then our tired feet protested too much, so we went back up to the busy Artist Point parking lot and begged a ride from a VERY kind hiking family from Bellingham. Thank you, lovely family!  <br /><br />We loved this hike, and we highly recommend trying it as a loop. It seemed that most people were doing it as an in-and-back from either Artist Point or Heather Meadows, but isn't a loop always better?<br /><br />If you aren't sure the Wild Goose Trail is open, bring two cars and leave one at each trailhead to make the short car shuttle.",

I took the trail clockwise which skirts around Table Mountain on the backside. Trail in good shape up to Ptarmagan trail cutoff. You make a right and start to decend down hill though a small patch of snow. Nothing to worry about. The first lake you come to is Mazama Lake. This is the first place you can camp. There are about four spots. Then you head up a muddy hill to you see Iceberg Lake. Very beautiful lake but only saw one iceberg, being that its late summer. I still saw some snow around the backside of the lake but nothing to walk through. Not far around the other end of the lake you come to Galena Lake. <br />These lakes can almost be seen at the same time. Another beautiful place to camp. <br />&nbsp;From there it is up hill. It is not too bad of a hill but do not forget to look back as the views on the way up are spectacular as you can see from one of my photos. The best place for lunch is at the pass. The views looking east to Mount Shuksan and West to Mount Baker are spectacular from my photos. I wished Mount Baker was clear of clouds but you have to take what you can get. You then descend down hill to Bagley Lakes. This is a long way but beautiful waterfalls and views down below make it worth it. Once you get down to the rock bridge past the first lake you need to crossover if you are hiking back up to Table Mountain parking lot. Go up hill to the visitor center. The trail which is called The Wild Goose Trail starts in the outer parking lot. There will be a big sign. Be prepared this is a grueling hike back up hill to the parking lot. You better like stairs because there is a few and they are steep. Not dangerous just steep. You will have to cross the road one time so be careful with kids because the cars don't pay much attention. This is a 7.5 mile loop and every bit worth the hike. If you hike Washginton State make it one of your top ten picks.

    "BodyText": "The Artist Point parking lot had a lot of cars but the crowds disappeared once I started hiking on the Chain Lakes trail (clockwise). At first the trail is mostly flat but after the intersection with Ptarmigan Ridge trail it switchbacks downhill towards the woods and the lakes. After Bagley Lake it switchbacks up to a rocky saddle and from there gradually goes downhill again for a couple more miles to the Visitor Center. From the Visitor Center it's maybe another steep mile back to the Artist Point parking lot.<br />The trail was very rocky the whole way and there were plenty of muddy and wet spots along it too. I had to get my feet wet crossing one of the streams but it wasn't bad. There's still summer lingering in the high country: there is plenty of wildflowers still blooming but barely any fall colors. The blueberries are ripe in patches, around the lakes they were still green though. Didn't see much wildlife.<br /><br />It was a very beautiful and fairly easy hike (aside from the rocky parts). I can't tell if going clockwise or counterclockwise is easier though.",

    "BodyText": "All I can say about this hike is it makes me want to come back again and again.  Amazing views of Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan were incredible especially on a clear blue sky day which we experienced both days.  The trail maintenance crews showed up as we were leaving so some parts of the trail had some sketcy spots but they did a good job making the trail more passable the next day.  Some of the adventure was crossing a large snow field on the way down to the first of the Chain Lakes but it was mostly &quot;just fun&quot; and not dangerous.  Iceburg Lake had plenty of iceburgs at this time which according to &quot;regulars&quot; was the most they had seen this time of year.  The bugs in the morning and especially at dusk were ravenous and made it hard to take sunset pictures that didn't have the nasty insects in the photos.  We camped at one of the campsites with a toilet at the third lake.  We didn't see many people the first day but as we were coming out the parking lot was full of people most of which were just checking out the views from the trailhead which alone was worth the drive.  We didn't hike the loop because we heard that there was a long stretch of snow on the trail and we wanted to see the views of Mt. Baker and Mt. Shuskin again.  No trip would be complete without a swim to the iceburgs in Iceburg Lake or at least that is what we thought. It was the coldest water that I have ever felt.  The return trip out was noticeably nicer due to the trail work the maintenance workers did.  Good job and thank you.  This is one hike that I could repeat over and over.  The sunset at Mt. Baker is must see at least once in your life.  ",
