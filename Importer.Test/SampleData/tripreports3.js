    "BodyText": "Index is a small town with ever going views of the tree filled Mountains. There was kind of an adventurous feel to this hike from the start. A short run down the railway, walk down on old trail and into a clearing where the fun begins. straight ahead is a small door in the base of the mountain with a picnic table out front. It looks so out of place yet it seems you would almost expect it to be there. There are huge pieces of rock that have fallen down from above. The trail is fairly steep from the bottom to the top, and a bit soggy near the beginning. There are many things to look at, moss and fungi cover most of the rocks and trees giving it a fern gully sort of feel. up through a few more rocks and you are almost there. you come to a cable sort of fence, the stream was almost dry so it was easy to get around. Follow the dry rocky creek bed up and you have made it. Its well worth the time as it is a fairly short hike for a one of a kind view. Standing tall over the tiny town of index,on the edge of a massive cliff! Hearing only the deep sounds of the rivers below. The hike took us 1.5 hours to get up and a half hour to get down. ",

    "BodyText": "Index Town Wall is a wonderful short early season snow free hike but it is every bit as strenuous as hikenwineguy described in his trip report.  The trail is steep and narrow and getting overgrown on the lower levels. There are several blowdowns that are easily stepped over and my hiking partner and I cut and cleared a good many.  There are 3 junctions.  The first two are pretty clear as one fork is blocked off.  Also look for the blue diamonds high up on the trees.  The 3rd junction is right in the face of a rock cliff.  Look for a pink ribbon high up to your left.  That's the way to go.<br /><br />This is a great time to climb this trail.  The new growth is just budding, the little ferns are uncurling, and fresh green sprouts are poking up in all their healthy hopeful exhuberance.  The flowers are tiny but very nice - starflower, bleeding heart, honeysuckle, and delicious miner's lettuce.  This lettuce here is sweet and bursting with chorophyll, not bitter or acidic like some.  <br /><br />At the top of the ridge there is a wire fence across a rivulet.  Turn left to follow an abandoned road through beautiful forest carpeted with fresh green mosses.  Turn right and go up the rivulet to the viewpoints.  On a clear day Mt. Baring, Mt. Index, Merchant Peak, and Perseus Mountain are all in their glory and today was special because they still had their snow.<br /><br />After a knee punishing climb down, enjoy a delicious coffee at the Espresso Chalet just up highway 2 from the junction into Index.",

    "BodyText": "Beautiful hike on a slighly hidden trail.  The hardest part of this hike was finding the trailhead.  NOTE...This trail is not for beginner hikers.<br /><br />To find the trailhead, drive HWY 2 to Index by making a left on Index-Galena Rd and cross the bridge into the town.  Head left on Index Ave (road bends to the left) and make a right on to Avenue A.  Drive for approx 1/2 mile until you find a gravel parking lot just in front of the railroad tracks.  Park your car and walk over the tracks, and begin to head right down the trail that follows the train tracks.  In about 200 yards there will be an old logging style road on your left, head up that road.  You know you are in the right place when you see the white doors on a tunnel heading into the mountains.  Walk past the picnic table and head to your right and towards the woods, you should find the trail easily and you may pass some climbers attempting to climb the wall.<br /><br />As i mentioned, this trail is not for beginners...it gets right to the point and starts to head up. The trail is thin, steep and some scrambling needs to take place in a few areas.  There is also a small &quot;washout&quot; area about midway up the trail.  At the first &quot;Y&quot; make a right, at the second &quot;Y&quot; make a left.  There are a series of switchbacks, natural staircases to climb and amazing views to see.  Almost to the top you come to a state park boundary, head right for the best views.  There is a ledge about 3 minutes from there.  Careful of the ledge and don't toss anything over, there may be climbers below.<br /><br />Views are amazing and include several mountains, rivers and the town of Index below.  <br /><br />All in all, this was a beautiful hike.  The ledge makes a perfect place for lunch.  The trail took about an hour to hike up and about 35 to hike down.  Estimates of altitude from google earth are about 1350 foot elevation gain and about 2.75 miles roundtrip.",

    "BodyText": "We headed to the Index Town Wall trail to enjoy an off-the-beaten-path hike with amazing interior and exterior scenery. The day was mostly cloudy, so we only had brief views of Mt Index on the way in. Index itself seemed worth the trip, a quaint little town surrounded by behemoths of plate subduction.<br /><br />First order of business: directions. I found the following directions elsewhere on the web (a rock climbing website?--don't remember) and they worked:<br />1. Highway 2 east to the Index-Galena Road. The I-G road is not marked as such. After milepost 34 and crossing the South Fork Skykomish River, be on the lookout for a paved turnoff with an arrow indicating &quot;Index&quot;. <br />2. Left on I-G road. Go about one mile. <br />3. Turn left on Fifth Street and cross the bridge into Index. <br />4. Turn left at Index Ave and cross the RR tracks. <br />5. Left onto Crescent Street.<br />6. Right onto Ave A and go 0.7 mile. Turn into the unmarked gravel parking lot on the right.<br /><br />We crossed the railroad tracks to the privy and (mistakenly) followed the trail to the Stimson Bullitt climbing reserve. We followed the trail along the base of the wall for a short distance. Rock climbers were out. However, we were badly outnumbered by brown and black slugs. What these small animals lack in size, speed, and agility is compensated by extreme ferocity, and we were forced to turn back. One of us sacrificed herself to a European brown slug to save the rest of us, God rest her soul.<br /><br />Actually, we realized that we had taken the wrong trail. We went back to the RR tracks, rather than attempt a bushwhack. We followed the tracks east (right from the parking lot) and turned left onto a wide trail/service road to a closed-off tunnel (former UW physics research site) at the base of the Index Town Wall. We followed the trail into the forest. The trail heads upwards steeply. At the first fork in the trail, we went right. At the next fork, we went left. Blue diamond markers on the trees are helpful. The trail then approaches a rock face. We took a fork left and continued our ascent. We reached a brown pipe-and-wire fence with orange ribbons that crosses a creek bed. We climbed over the fence, making a right turn, and headed up the creek. A short distance later we encountered a lookout point (with signs explaining &quot;Falling Can Be Deadly&quot;) offering views of Index, Mount Index, and the Skykomish River valley. <br /><br />As it was cloudy, views were limited. From the lower lookout points we had limited views of Mount Index. We did not encounter any other hikers on the trail. The trail is in excellent condition given the limited traffic, without significant mud or water. Poles are helpful as there are several spots that require hand-holds or assistance with footing. At the top, we had no real view, due to clouds at that elevation. On the way down, I saw my first banana slug of the day as well as nice views of Mount Index. Back in Index, we were treated to glimpses of Mount Index and Baring Mountain, enticing us to return on a day with more open views.",

Turn right onto Avenue &quot;A&quot; and continue .6 mile along the river (pass the Index Sportsmen Club) to the parking area and climbers trailhead (on the right).<br /><br />There is a porta-potty at the trailhead, but the park in Index has clean and well-maintained bathrooms with running water. No water source besides the Index coffee shop.<br /><br />Once I was on the trail, the trip reports from below were invaluable. Thanks to all the previous hikers who contributed.<br /><br />I met one couple and their dog on the way up, but otherwise had the trail completely to myself. It was a great workout with gorgeous views at the two lookouts.<br /><br />If you have any issues with your knees, bring a walking stick to help stabilize you on the way down. The ground is soft from recent rains and the steep decline made for a slippery descent.",

About a half mile down the road water covers the road. Bushwhacking around this I found more and more water in numerous tarns (maybe &quot;big puddles&quot; would be more accurate). Eventually getting around the water obstacles involved bushwhacking far off the road. Finally the road is bisected by a very large and impassable creek. Whoever used this road tried at least twice to get over the creek, first with a huge log track and also with a crude bridge. Both succumbed to the creek; the log track is now under water and the bridge collapsed into the creek leaving a hanging roadway.<br /><br />Though this &quot;trail&quot; is not for everybody (very steep, brushy, muddy, rooty, rocky), it can be an exceptional and easily accessible photo-op on a clear day.

    "BodyText": "Janice Van Cleve posted a really good description of this hike last week, and I managed to get lost anyway.  To be honest, there have been a series of posts about this hike, each building upon the last, but not always converging upon a common understanding of the route-- or at least that's the way it appears to me-- apologies to all previous trip reporters if I simply didn't understand their posts correctly.  <br /><br />For starters, finding the trailhead is a bit tricky.  Basically you need to cross the bridge into the town of Index, and then do your best to follow the railroad tracks downstream (more or less to the West, although my mental compass told me I was headed due South).  The road through Index separates from the RR tracks for a while, and there are speed bumps in the road to discourage you from speeding.  You'll know you're very close when the roadway rejoins the railroad tracks (which make a big letter 'U' around the town).  Pretty much as soon as you see the RR tracks again, you'll notice a cleared camping area next to the river on left, and an unsigned turnout to a parking area on your right.  Park here.  From the parking area, follow the obvious trail up to (and across) the RR tracks.  Then turn immediately right, and walk along the tracks roughly a 10th of a mile until (as Ms. Van Cleve posted) you get to an &quot;authorized vehicles only&quot; sign. Enter here and you will come to the base of an impressive rock cliff with a sealed tunnel at its base. <br /><br />Follow the trail upwards.  After about 1/2 mile of steep elevation gain, reach the first 'Y' intersection.  Choose the right-hand path.  Roughly 1/10th of a mile later reach a second 'Y' intersection.  Here is where I got lost.  JVC, terpene, and geezerhiker all make reference to a path marked by blue diamonds on the trees.  This is the path to left-- I know because I followed it for 20 minutes.  However, it kept leading SW (downstream, in the general direction back towards Hwy 2), and after a while I became quite concerned that I was headed in the opposite direction of the lookout point (which is shown at the opposite end of the wall on the climber's map [please see JVC's posting for the URL to the climber's map]).  This could easily have been a mistake on my part, but I decided to abandon the blue diamond (i.e. Left-hand ) route and backtrack to the 2nd 'Y' intersection and try the right-hand path. <br /><br />This path was not marked, and was a little hard to follow at times, especially in the first quarter mile.  After that it was easy to follow.  I eventually worked my way up to an unforested opening at the middle of the sheer Index Wall; a thin sheet of water sparkled and slid its way down the rock.  This place is marked &quot;waterfall&quot; on the aforementioned climber's map.  From here, at first, I couldn't tell how the trail continued; eventually I went diagonally downward thru the rocky clearing (only 30 feet or so, but no obvious trail) and saw where the trail picked up again.  I went a bit further, but saw no signs of an obvious lookout.  At this point I determined I should have stuck with the 'blue diamond' path after all; but I was quite happy to have discovered the little waterfall.  If anyone who reads this can make sense of the paths I took and can tell me what the correct way to the lookout was, I would really appreciate it.",

The map at www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/trailmap.gif indicates many trails around and along the top of the Wall, but the reality on the ground is somewhat different.<br /><br />To get to the trailhead, go through Index south along the road until you come to a small, unmarked parking lot next to the railroad tracks.  Cross the tracks and immediately follow the road alongside the track until you get to an &quot;authorized vehicles only&quot; sign.

It is a bushwhacking scramble over boulders the size of condominiums and no fun.<br /><br />The trail from the Doors of Durin climb steeply through many switchbacks 1/2 mile to a junction.  Go right 0.1 miles to another junction marked by blue diamonds on the trees.  The map says there is a trail to the right but there really isn't.  Go left another 1/2 mile around the south shoulder of the Wall then ascend more switchbacks.  The trail is easy to see and no obstructions or snow.  There are plenty of blue diamond markers.  Go under the cable fence with flags hanging on it and up the creek bed about 35 yards to a wonderful lookout.  Great place for lunch.<br /><br />Don't forget Espresso Chalet on Highway 2 just east of Index.  Great way to reward yourself for a good hike.",

    "BodyText": "Every time I hiked to Lake Serene I've looked across the Skykomish River valley at the cliffs of the Index Town Wall and imagined the views from the top, and how to get up there. Recent trip reports at WTA supplied the information on the latter and I took advantage of a sunny day to check it out.<br /><br />With the directions from geezerhiker (31 Jan 2011) in hand, and following a climber's hand-drawn map (<a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/trailmap.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/trailmap.gif</a>) I set out from an empty parking lot.<br /><br />Knowing that this is really a climbers' trail, I expected a steep and rough slog, and found exactly that. The trail is sometimes faint, but always there, though you might have to stop and look hard at times. If you're on trail you'll know it, since the hard-to-see sections are never more than ten or twenty feet long. If you go farther without seeing an obvious trail, turn around, retrace your steps, and look again.<br /><br />This last is important because, this being basically a big cliff with a few clefts where a trail might fit, there are plenty of places where wandering off-trail may lead to a sudden and supremely unpleasant surprise (like falling off the cliff).<br /><br />I found geezerhiker's directions to be spot on and easy to follow, but I've also uploaded a copy of the aforementioned trail map with the route highlighted in green. Don't rely too much on the occasional blue diamond markers tacked to trees along the trail - though accurate, they seem to appear only at crucial waypoints; better to rely on your trailfinding instincts for the most part.<br /><br />I could go on about the vistas at the end-of-trail viewpoint but will let the pictures say it for me. I rarely spend much time at trail turnarounds, but couldn't bring myself to leave this one. It's a beaut.<br /><br />BTW, be careful at the viewpoint. Over the edge, from this pleasant granite outcrop, it's a straight 1200' freefall to the bottom. The first few seconds would be great, but the ending would not!",

    "BodyText": "This is a good &quot;stay fit&quot; winter hike.  I attempted to reach the upper wall last Monday, but took the wrong trail.  There are great views of the Skykomish River, Mt. Baring, Mt. Index, and the town of Index from the upper wall.  To get there take the trail to the right of the sealed tunnel at the lower wall.  Blue diamonds indicate the correct trail.  About 1/2 mile up the steep (1,400' in 1.5 miles)trail bear right at the &quot;Y.&quot;  About 0.1 mile after the &quot;Y,&quot; turn left on the blue diamond trail and follow it up through the woods.  The trail is somewhat obsscure from small branches and leaves, but there is a definite trail.  When you reach a cable fence that is flagged, turn right and follow the creek bed until you reach the viewpoint.  ",

    "BodyText": "This was my first trip to the Index Town Wall.  The trailhead isn't easy to find and the trail is steep, but the terrain is interesting.  Research said to &quot;always choose the path that continues uphill,&quot; but it didn't say what to do at the &quot;Y&quot; about a mile up the trail.  Both trails go equally uphill, so I tried the left fork.  That led to two interesting dead ends, one with a partial view.  The views were foggy (in spite of a report of 10 miles of visibility at Index), so I headed back and marked the fork on my GPS.  I'll try the right fork next time and see if that takes me to the top.  If anyone has been there, please confirm my assessment.  I drove up the road a few minutes and stopped to look at Eagle Falls, figuring that it would be running full from the recent rains.  I was not disappointed.  The trail has a few easily-cleared blowdowns, but there are no major problems.",
